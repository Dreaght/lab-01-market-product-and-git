## Roles and responsibilities

### 1. Back-end Engineer
Back-end engineers design and implement server-side logic, APIs, and data processing components.
They ensure correctness, performance, and scalability of services such as homeservers, APIs, and media handling.

### 2. Distributed Systems Engineer
Distributed systems engineers work on components that operate across multiple nodes and networks, such as federation between homeservers.
They focus on consistency, fault tolerance, replication, and handling network failures.

### 3. DevOps / Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
DevOps/SRE specialists are responsible for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining production systems.
They automate infrastructure, ensure high availability, handle incidents, and optimize system reliability.

### 4. Mobile Engineer (iOS / Android)
Mobile engineers develop and maintain native client applications for mobile platforms.
They focus on user experience, performance, offline support, and correct synchronization with backend services.

### 5. Security Engineer
Security engineers analyze and mitigate security risks in protocols and implementations.
They work on authentication, encryption, secure communication, threat modeling, and vulnerability management.


## Common skills across roles

- Understanding of distributed systems concepts (replication, eventual consistency, fault tolerance)
- Proficiency in at least one programming language (e.g., Java, Kotlin, Go, Python, Rust)
- Experience with HTTP-based APIs and JSON data formats
- Knowledge of authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Familiarity with databases (SQL and NoSQL)
- Experience with Linux-based systems and networking fundamentals
- Version control systems (e.g., Git)
- Basic security principles (encryption, secure communication, access control)
- Debugging, logging, and monitoring practices
